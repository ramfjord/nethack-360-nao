This is a fork of the Nethack 3.6.0 source code, with a couple of minor modifications:

* statuscolors and a couple of other usability patches from https://github.com/Elronnd/nethack-360-nao
* modified configuration for use with dgamelaunch on a debian instance

Check the commit history for the modifications I made to work with dgamelaunch - I've configured the server to run in a chroot jail in /opt/nethack-server.  If anyone else is using this they may want to modify that or other settings I changed.

To modify the source, I followed [Paxed's instructions](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/User:Paxed/HowTo_setup_dgamelaunch), with some slight modifications which were necessary after upgrading from 3.4.3 to 3.6.0.
